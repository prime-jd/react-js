# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React Routers
In React, "React Router" is a popular library used for handling routing in web applications. It enables developers to create single-page applications with multiple views without the page refreshing as the user navigates through the application. React Router provides a declarative way to define routes using components.

```
npm install react-router-dom
